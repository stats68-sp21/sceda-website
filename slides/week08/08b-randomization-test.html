class: middle

Can this observed difference in promotion rates (0.2916667) be due to chance rather than gender discrimination?

---

class: middle

## Steps

1.Shuffle the 48 personnel files.   
2.Deal the 48 files into to two stacks. Stack 1 will have 35 files that represent the promoted files. Stack 2 will have 13 files that are not promoted.  
3.Calculate the differences in promotion rates of males and females.   
4.Repeat this process multiple times.
